\textbf{Also, only for this week: Personal Intro}

Hi, my name is Leidong Xu and have been studying mechanical and nuclear engineering in K-state for five years. This acdemic year will be the second year for my master degree. My thesis is related to using numerical method solving engineering and science problems on Computational Fluid Dynamics and Nuclear systems, which inlcude preconditioner and multigrid method.
